# Overview

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the **OverTheWire** wargames, a collection of interactive challenges designed to teach Linux command-line skills, security concepts, and penetration testing techniques. This repository documents my solutions, explanations, and insights for various wargames, starting with the Bandit series and expanding to others like Leviathan, Natas, and more.

The goal is to provide detailed, beginner-friendly guides for each wargame level, explaining the commands, tools, and logic used to solve them. Whether you're new to Linux, scripting, or web security, or an experienced user honing your skills, this repository serves as a resource to learn, understand, and master the OverTheWire challenges.

# About OverTheWire Wargames

The **OverTheWire** wargames are hands-on exercises that teach practical skills in system administration, networking, scripting, and security. Each wargame focuses on different aspects of cybersecurity:

- **Bandit**: Introduces Linux command-line basics, file manipulation, permissions, networking, and scripting.

- **Leviathan**: Focuses on Linux system vulnerabilities and binary exploitation.

- **Natas**: Explores web security, including SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypass.

- **Other Wargames**: Cover advanced topics like reverse engineering, cryptography, and exploit development.

Each level requires finding a password or flag to progress, using techniques ranging from simple commands to complex scripting and vulnerability exploitation. This repository provides walkthroughs, code, and explanations to help you navigate these challenges.
